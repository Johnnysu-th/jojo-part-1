                The story opens in the late 19th century, introducing Jonathan Joestar, a kind-hearted young man, and his adopted brother, Dio Brando. Dio, an orphan taken in by Jonathan's wealthy father, secretly harbors immense malice and an insatiable desire to usurp Jonathan's inheritance. From childhood, Dio systematically torments Jonathan, attempting to ruin his reputation, humiliating his beloved Erina, and brutally burning Jonathan's dog, Danny, to death.
                As Jonathan matures, he suspects Dio is poisoning his father. While seeking an antidote and evidence in London, Dio inadvertently discovers a mysterious artifact from Jonathan's research: the Stone Mask. This ancient relic, when exposed to blood, transforms its wearer into an immortal, supernaturally strong vampire. When Dio's treachery is finally exposed, he embraces his dark ambition, dons the Stone Mask, and becomes a vampire. He murders Jonathan's father, grievously wounds Jonathan, and sets the Joestar mansion ablaze.
                Faced with Dio's monstrous transformation, a grief-stricken Jonathan vows vengeance. He soon encounters Baron Will A. Zeppeli, a master of Hamon (Ripple) – a martial art that harnesses controlled breathing to generate sun-like energy, the ultimate weakness of vampires. Under Zeppeli’s rigorous guidance, Jonathan trains diligently.  Joined by Zeppeli, the loyal Robert E. O. Speedwagon, and other Hamon practitioners, Jonathan embarks on a perilous quest to confront Dio and his growing army of undead servants.
                The climactic battle takes place in the ancestral Joestar castle. Jonathan heroically manages to decapitate Dio, seemingly ending his reign of terror. However, a fanatical subordinate rescues Dio's head, aiming to transplant it onto Jonathan's body. On a sinking ship, as Jonathan attempts to save Erina, he sustains mortal wounds. In a final, desperate act of sacrifice, Jonathan clutches Dio's disembodied head as the ship explodes, preventing Dio's immediate revival. Erina, miraculously pregnant with Jonathan's child, survives the ordeal, ensuring the continuation of the Joestar bloodline and igniting the century-long, fated rivalry between the Joestar and Brando families.

Trained by the master Zeppeli, he learns to harness this power to battle his adoptive brother and nemesis, Dio Brando. Despite Dio’s betrayal and supernatural power, Jonathan faces him with bravery and selflessness. In the end, Jonathan sacrifices his life to stop Dio, saving his wife and ensuring the survival of the Joestar bloodline. His legacy lives on, setting the foundation for the heroes of later generations.
